## Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my corner of GitHub

I'm an **Embedded Systems Engineer** specializing in **Automotive Software** development and **Virtual ECU (vECU)** simulation. With deep expertise in **AUTOSAR**, **RTOS**, and **Linux** environments, I build robust, real-time systems that power modern vehicles. My work spans across system architecture, simulation frameworks, and rigorous testing methodologies—always thinking at the system level to ensure reliability and performance.

### 🔧 Core Technologies
- **Languages:** C, C++, Python
- **Automotive:** AUTOSAR, CAN, SOME/IP, vECU
- **RTOS & Embedded:** FreeRTOS, Zephyr, Linux
- **DevOps & Tools:** Yocto, QEMU, Docker, Git
- **Focus Areas:** Simulation, System Testing, Real-time Performance

### 🚀 What I Do
I design and implement embedded software solutions for automotive applications, with a strong emphasis on simulation-driven development and comprehensive testing. Whether it's building virtual ECU environments, integrating middleware stacks, or optimizing RTOS performance, I thrive on solving complex system-level challenges.
